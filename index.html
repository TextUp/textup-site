                <p><b>From over-200 interviews</b> with staff, directors, and clients of social service agencies, we know that lack of information leads to frustration, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to help people help themselves leave homelessness. Yet in metropolitan areas across the US, <b>50 to 70% of people who are homeless have working mobile phones</b>. Up to <b>90% of those phones have unlimited texting</b>. TextUp is a text messaging service that increases staff-client engagement and tracks effectiveness of communication with clients, among staff, and with other social service providers.</p>
